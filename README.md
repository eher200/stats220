# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in science majoring in Psychology.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I really enjoyed STATS 100 (especially the coding part) and want to learn more.
- I am interested in learning about how to code (and be creative with it!), and especially how I can transfer these skills to my psychology degree and personal life.
